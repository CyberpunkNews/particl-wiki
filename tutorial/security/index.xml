However if you want to backup all the additional data like addresses saved in Address Book and more, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to backup your wallet.dat file.
Always backup your wallet.dat to a secure place (USB, external drive etc.) â€“ if anyone would get access to it and knew your wallet password, they could steal your coins!</description></item></channel></rss>
