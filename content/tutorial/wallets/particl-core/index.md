Particl Core is more lightweight than [Particl Desktop](/tutorial/wallets/particl-desktop/), offers some advanced features like Coin Control and compatibility with [hardware wallets](/learn/wallets/hardware/).

However it acts like a wallet only, so you won't have access to Particl Open Marketplace.
