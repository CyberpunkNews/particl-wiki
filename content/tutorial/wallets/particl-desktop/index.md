While it does not currently contain all advanced features (like [Particl Core](/tutorial/particl-core/)), Particl Desktop is a recommended wallet for majority of users.

This wallet is intended to be the centerpiece and default wallet of the Particl platform and is heavily under development. More features are added with every new release.
