## Advantages

Accepting Particl (and many other cryptocurrencies) gives you – as a Seller – many advantages over traditional fiat payment systems:

- **No chargebacks** – all cryptocurrency transactions are final, no chargebacks are possible
- **Complete control** – you are the only owner of the private keys to your wallet, no one can freeze your account or shut it down

**If further security and financial privacy are important to your and your business**, see our [Particl Open Marketplace](learn:market:), which was developed with exactly those in mind.

## Online stores

Accepting PART payments in your online stores is possible with use of Particl [BTCPayServer](/tutorial/merchants/part-payment-processor/). Hosting it on your server and connecting your wallet will allow receiving payments directly to your wallet (even a cold storage via [hardware wallets](/learn/wallets/hardware)) and detailed tracking of paid orders etc.


## Physical stores

Easiest way to accept PART in your physical store is via **[Particl Copay](/tutorial/wallets/particl-copay/) mobile/desktop wallet**.

Main advantages of using Particl Copay:

- **Fast & mobile**
- **Completely free** – no registration needed, no payment processing fees, no monthly fees
- **Multi-currency wallet** – supports both Particl (PART) and Bitcoin (BTC)
- **Fiat conversion rates**
  - so you can charge buyers in your local currency, which gets translated to corresponding PART/BTC prices
  - also useful for taxing purposes
- **Multiple wallets** – you can separate sales into different wallets, as needed and on-the-fly
- **Transaction labeling** – add custom notes/labels to transactions if needed
