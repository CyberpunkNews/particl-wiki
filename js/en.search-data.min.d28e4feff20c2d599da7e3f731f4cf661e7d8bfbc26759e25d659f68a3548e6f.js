This can become a problem when the size of the blockchain becomes too big that most people start connecting on third-party nodes instead of their own. It is also highly impractical to store full nodes on personal computers when they are several GBs or even TBs.\nOne solution currently under development to increase the scalability of the RingCT privacy protocol is Bulletproofs, “a new, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup”.\nThis protocol is expected to reduce the RingCT and CT transaction sizes by around 80% and as such, constitute a very important item in our scalability strategy.  Read the full Bulletproofs whitepaper co-authored by Benedikt Bunz, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew Poelstra, Pieter Wuille, and Greg Maxwell.\nLightning Network Lightning network for Particl is not yet implemented  The Lightning Network is a decentralized payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in their Lightning Network whitepaper and powered using smart-contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant, near-zero fee payments across a network of participants.\nInstant Payments Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.\nScalability Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\nLow Cost By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.\nCross-Chain Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across blockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\nData Storage Network (DSN) Read more about Open Marketplace-related scalability with Data Storage Network (DSN)  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/learn/blockchain/particl-specifications/','title':"Specifications",'content':"Blockchain          Codebase Always up-to-date with latest Bitcoin Core   Consensus mechanism Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)   Block time 120 seconds (5× faster than BTC)   Block size 2 MB (2× larger than BTC)    Coin supply          Total \u0026amp; circulating supply 9+ million PART (check link for exact number)   Community fund ~33,000 PART (owned by PART community)    Staking          Block reward ~0.97 PART   Coin maturity 225 confirmations (~8 hours)   Yearly interest rate Min. 3% (based on network weight), decreasing by 1% every year until 2%   Particl Cold Staking Quantum-resistant cold staking with support for hardware wallets    Features          SegWit Native, enabled by default for all transactions   Atomic Swaps Enabled \u0026amp; compatible   Transaction Types Public (pseudonymous, like BTC), Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT (on testnet, in development)   Multi-sig security Supported with Particl Copay   Lightning Network Coming soon   Bulletproofs Enabled (on testnet, in development)    "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/learn/privacy/transaction-types/','title':"Transaction types",'content':"As the highest privacy state requires the most transaction fee, it may not always be the best type of transaction depending on the situation, especially when privacy is not predominantly required by the user.\n Particl\u0026#39;s multiple privacy states      Public Blind Anon     Staking      Privacy ∗ ∗∗ ∗∗∗   Hidden TX amount      Anon TX participants      TX fees $ $$ $$$       Open Marketplace Public Blind Anon     Paying for Listing fees  – –   Flagging items  – –   Purchasing items – –    Funding MAD Escrow – –     Why has PART different privacy states?\n Freedom of choice To keep the process of coin minting transparent and have a fully auditable supply.

Mathematical and cryptographic details related to the CT privacy protocol are available on Maxwell’s original investigation into the protocol.\n Anon (RingCT) This type of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol developed by Shen Noether to hide both transferring amounts and participants’ blockchain identity by combining Cryptonote’s ring signatures and Maxwell’s CT protocols. It is the one of the highest level of trustless privacy protocol the crypto industry has to offer and was made famous by Monero.\nIt is also the most expensive privacy setting to use.\nMathematical and cryptographic details related to the RingCT privacy protocol are available on Shen Noether’s RingCT whitepaper.\n  "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/learn/blockchain/','title':"Blockchain",'content':"    Latest Bitcoin codebase Particl is a privacy coin built from the Bitcoin Core codebase and is always updated to its latest version     Scalability Particl\u0026#39;s approach to scalability     Specifications      "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/tutorial/getting-started/','title':"Getting started",'content':"This series of guides will walk you through the first steps into Particl ecosystem.

It operates with no central authority or middleman and is exclusively owned and operated by its network of participants. Its decentralized nature enables new opportunities that cannot be offered by any other marketplace.\nThe Open Marketplace focuses on four core values: privacy, security, scalability, and absolute decentralization. It attains this goal by leveraging a combination of many different protocols. Each of these protocols contribute to Particl\u0026rsquo;s core values in their own way.\nTo access Particl Open Marketplace\nfollow our Getting started with Open Marketplace guide!  Features  Open Marketplace infographic   The Open Marketplace is private by default.\n This means it automatically keeps users' identities and data private without requiring any extra step from the user. The only exception to that rule is the Tor setup which isn\u0026rsquo;t enabled by default for security measures.\nThe Particl team is committed to only use the best privacy protocols the industry offers. It also constantly research, develop, and maintain the solutions deployed in the marketplace. As absolute privacy and security is the modus operandi of the project, it supersedes anything else. This means there is no concession made that would weaken the privacy setup of the marketplace in favor of something else.\nPayments  All payments and transactions made on the Open Marketplace are untraceable by default.\n This is achieved by leveraging the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT capabilities of the Particl coin (PART). These two protocols are integrated as the default types of payments, as specified by the OMP.\nCT and RingCT transactions have been historically used on the Cryptonote codebase. Yet, the Particl team has adapted these protocols to be compatible with the Bitcoin codebase, which is the codebase used for the PART coin. The Bitcoin codebase gives more flexibility, security, and stability to the PART coin that the Cryptonote codebase would. A good example for this is the ability for the RingCT and CT protocols to interact with smart-contracts (i.e. the Open Marketplace). The coin also uses the Bulletproofs CT protocol improvement (currently on testnet) which reduces range proofs by about 70%. This ensures marketplace payments are both anonymous and scalable at the same time.\nListings Public listings on Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace are listings that are publicly available. Anyone can search for these listings using keywords and by navigating to the correct categories. Although these listings are public, they still offer a great level of privacy as all transactions are untraceable by default.\nThe only “identifiable” data public listings reveal is a unique and anonymous vendor ID. This ID cannot, however, link to any payment address or traceable identity.\nParticl Open Marketplace also offers Private listings on users' \u0026ldquo;private markets\u0026rdquo;, called Private Bubbles  No metadata  The Open Marketplace does not generate any sort of traceable data.\n That much is true whether you are a buyer or a vendor. Metadata is “data about data” and can be very useful to track users. For example, pictures usually carry data such as the device used to take the picture, when it was taken, and even the precise geo-location of where the picture was taken. Any data stored off-chain on Particl\u0026rsquo;s network is immediately stripped of all its metadata, making it impossible to trace people using metadata. This behavior is enabled by Particl\u0026rsquo;s SMSG Data Storage Network.\nIP address anonymization IP addresses can easily be anonymized on the Open Marketplace by installing Tor and editing the configuration file of your Particl Desktop client. Doing so shields you from getting your real IP address to be broadcast to the network.\nParticl Desktop currently doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically route connections through Tor for security measures. If that were the case, a new Particl Desktop version would need to be installed by the user every time Tor pushes a new update. Automatic Tor updates, on the other hand, introduce severe security vulnerabilities, especially in regards to the authenticity of the files being automatically pushed to the client.\nThe Particl team is aware of a few solutions to circumvent this issue. It is also looking into alternatives to Tor. Automatic IP address anonymization should make their way onto Particl Desktop in the future.\n"});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/learn/misc/proposals/','title':"Proposals",'content':" This article hasn't been written yet, we're working on it!

Private by design Scalability     About MAD Escrow Marketplaces usually have mechanisms in place to resolve disputes between buyers and vendors. This is a vital part of e-commerce because trusting strangers, especially when money is involved, has never proven to be reliable. As buyers and vendors do not know and trust each other, there has to be protection against one of the party never honoring their end of the trade.\nOne common solution marketplaces and payment processors use is a mutually-trusted third party (in other words, an escrow agent). On decentralized marketplaces, not only does this represents scalability and privacy issues but it also does not offer any protection against collusion between the escrow agent and one of the party.\nParticl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace solves this problem without the need for a third party.\nIt uses what is called MAD escrow smart-contracts. This type of escrow does not cost any fee, is infinitely scalable and private by design.  Game Theory  Particl\u0026#39;s MAD Escrow logo  Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender, thus making their use not an option.\nIt is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy\u0026rsquo;s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.\nParticl’s MAD escrow mechanism replaces the nuclear annihilation deterrence factor of the MAD game theory for a mutual financial loss should one party acts dishonestly.\nHow does it work? Particl uses the BIP 65 opcode, which allows a transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, to enable MAD escrow contracts. It locks funds in a secure multi-signature address until all the parties sign off on the transaction.\nThe seller starts by depositing an amount they want the buyer to match. The deposit can be between 0–100 % of the purchased item’s price.\nHowever, optimal MAD odds are achieved when the security deposit equals 100 % of the item’s price. The buyer then deposits an equal amount plus the price of the item they are buying. This double security deposit symbolizes a virtual handshake between the buyer and the vendor.\nThe escrowed funds are not released to any party until both confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily. To avoid filibustering, the MAD smart-contract has a timer that runs for a pre-determined duration of time. This can be extended if both parties agree. Once it runs out of time, the funds are locked forever. This prevents both parties from willingly delaying and hindering the escrow process.\nWhen both parties are satisfied with the outcome of the transaction, they have to confirm the transaction as complete. The payment is then released to the vendor and the security deposits are refunded to both parties at no fee.\nPrivate by design  Particl’s MAD escrow system renders the marketplace fully fungible. That\u0026rsquo;s because all transactions are untraceable by default.\n In fact, not only is all marketplace content encrypted, but all currency transactions are made untraceable through the use of the RingCT privacy protocol. This technique enhances privacy much more than if CT MAD escrow was optional because it dramatically increases the number of private transactions on the network.\nAnother privacy-enhancing aspect of the MAD escrow mechanism is its lack of third-party acting as escrow agent. In fact, in most centralized escrow system, conversations between the buyer and the seller are available to the escrow agent. This is so the escrow agent can step in if any problem arises and issue a resolution based on the context. This puts a lot of power into the agent\u0026rsquo;s hands and assumes it is acting in an honest way.\nBy not requiring any third-party, the Open Marketplace\u0026rsquo;s escrow system preserves the privacy of both parties. Any transaction detail or conversation is only available to the transacting parties and no one else.\nScalability  This form of decentralized escrow is infinitely scalable. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any other party other than the ones transacting to function.\n This means there is no friction whatsoever, and that as many escrow transactions can be opened as required by the users. No staff is required, no data can be mined, and no delay can be caused by outside parties. The Particl network can support an infinite number of escrow deals at the same time.\n"});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/tutorial/wallets/particl-core/','title':"Particl Core",'content':" Preview of Particl Core  Particl Core is more lightweight than Particl Desktop, offers some advanced features like Coin Control and compatibility with hardware wallets.\nHowever it acts like a wallet only, so you won\u0026rsquo;t have access to Particl Open Marketplace.\n Download Particl Core   Report bugs   Features Browse \u0026amp; compare Particl Core\u0026rsquo;s features with other available wallets.\nGetting started Installation Please note that even though some of these steps are optional/recommended, it is highly advised to follow all of them as it secures your funds from being lost.

In PoS-based cryptocurrencies, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection of wealth and age. In contrast, the algorithm of Proof-of-Work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining).\nPPoS is built and improved upon the popular PoS3 protocol on top of which were added several security and utility features.\nHow to stake on Particl?\nFollow our guides at Tutorial: How to Stake  Passive Income PPoS can serve as a great passive income tool. It rewards stakers a minmum rate of 5% per year for securing the network, then drops 1% every year until it plateaus at 2%:\n   Period Staking rewards / inflation rate     July 2017 – July 2018 5 %   July 2018 – July 2019 4 %   July 2019 – July 2020 3 %   July 2020 onwards 2 %    This staking reward rate is true if 100% of the total supply is put up for staking, but gets higher as less coins are being staked. For example, if 50% of the total network is being put up for staking, the staking reward rate for the first year would be of 10%.  The Particl platform also redirects any fee generated from it directly to stakers, including but not limited to currency transactions, marketplace listing fees, extended messaging, privacy balance transfers and others, meaning staking becomes more profitable as the platform gets more traffic.\nCold Staking Cold staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins.\nCold staking nodes are intended to be used in combination with cold, hardware and multisig addresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being hacked or exposing your public key to the network. Staking nodes can be set up on any device, secure or not, such as public/cloud servers, virtual machines or DSDs.\nHow to cold stake on Particl?\nFollow our guide at Tutorial: Cold Staking setup  Cold Hardware Staking It is currently possible to cold stake funds stored offline on a hardware wallet by setting up a Particl wallet on a Ledger hardware wallet.\nWhile cold staking does not store any password in memory and delegates staking powers to empty staking nodes, a cold wallet is still vulnerable when it\u0026rsquo;s interacted with (i.e. when a transaction is executed) from an infected or untrusted computer. Hardware wallets fix this issue by not requiring any exchange of private key between the hardware wallet and the device/computer it is connected to, thus making hardware wallets safe even when they are interacted with from an infected computer.\nCombining cold staking and hardware security effectively makes PPoS the most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol in the industry and fixes several issues generally associated with the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol in general.  Quantum-resistance \u0026amp; Privacy Current Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in Proof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they find and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against public key cryptography.\nOn traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128 basic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public keys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be estimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue, but any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should tackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a private key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is available in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public addresses with large amounts and reverse those.\nWhen a Particl block is staked from a cold staking node, the private key of the address on the staking node (which contains no coin) is broadcasted to the network instead of the private key of the address which contains the staking funds. Because cold staking nodes are able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold, cold stakers can effectively remain anonymous and shielded from theoretical quantum computer attacks.\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/learn/staking/pools/','title':"Cold Staking Pools",'content':"    The importance of decentralization Available Staking Pools Advanced  Running your own Pool        In the context of cryptocurrency mining, a mining pool is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network, to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. — Wikipedia\n In fact, cold staking pools allow you to “team up” with other stakers and combine your staking powers in order to earn more frequent staking rewards. All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.\nHow to cold stake on a Pool?\nFollow our guide at Tutorial: Cold Staking setup  The importance of decentralization It is highly recommended to be careful about which cold staking pool you choose to stake your funds with. In fact, because you are effectively delegating your staking power to a third-party, staking from a cold staking pool tends to centralize the staking weight of the network.  In order to be as secure as possible, Proof-of-Stake blockchains need to both have as many coins being staked as possible and as many staking nodes online as possible. The reason behind this is actually similar to Proof of Work\u0026rsquo;s 51% attack where an attacker could get full control over the blockchain if he held more than 50% of all the hashing power (mining power) on the network.\nOn Particl, this attack vector is still possible, although a bit different. For such an exploit to be successful, an attacker, like a malicious pool operator, would need to be in possession of more than 50% of all staking coins. This is the reason you should always be careful not to delegate your staking power to a pool that already holds a considerably high amount of staking weight.\nThe Particl team is not responsible for the management, user support, and debugging of any pool.\nWhile we will offer support for the cold staking pool code itself, we won’t be offering support for any of its implementation made by third-parties; this responsibility should lie within the pool operator himself.

Depending on various variables such as what kind of products you sell, the number of transactions you do, your membership subscription plan, your feedback, and similar sets of data, fees can vary greatly.\nThe total cost associated with selling online usually includes a listing fee, a final value fee (sales fee taken on the value of the item), a subscription fee, a payment processing fee, escrow fee, and more. This is a direct consequence of using third-parties (centralized marketplaces). Every party that contributes to a transaction wants a “piece of the pie” and get paid for the services they offer. This is perfectly normal and expected.\nParticl fees Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace has a different approach.\n Because the marketplace is run collectively by its users, there is no operational cost associated with it.\n  Comparison of fee structure across online marketplaces  There is also no company looking into making profits out of its operation. This allows the marketplace to charge the bare minimum for it to operate.\nThe Open Marketplace doesn\u0026rsquo;t charge its buyers with any fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee. Its vendors, on the other hand, are only charged with a very small listing fee amounting to only a few cents per item. This is only designed to fight off spam listings and keep the interface clean.\n Particl\u0026rsquo;s fee schedule is unmatched in the e-commerce industry and beats any centralized marketplaces.\n It empowers both vendors and buyers by letting vendors make more profit per sale or by allowing them to reduce their prices to attract more buyers, thus getting bigger sales volume. Vendors make more profits, buyers gain access to cheaper products.

Votes are tallied based on coin weight where one coin equals one vote. The more coins a user holds, the more influence he has over the outcome of a flagging vote.\nOnce a certain weight threshold is reached, the listing is taken out of the marketplace. This also applies to private listings even though they do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace.

Atomic Swaps Third-Party Integrations     What\u0026rsquo;s currency agnosticism? That means buyers aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to using the PART coin as a form of payment. They are able to use many currencies, including Bitcoin, among others. This provides a use-case for many different coins and gives them a fee-less and untraceable way to spend their cryptocurrencies without having to either go through a third-party or sell their coins for fiat on exchanges.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that, even though many coins can be used as a form of payment, all non-PART transactions are automatically converted into PART transactions by the marketplace. This is because the escrow smart-contract needs to use PART in order to operate. The PART coin is also required for the escrow mechanism to execute transactions anonymously (it uses PART\u0026rsquo;s CT and RingCT privacy protocols).\nThe integration of other coins can be achieved in two ways:\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps are decentralized and trustless trades between two users of different cryptocurrencies.\nThey involve each party paying into a contract transaction, one contract for each blockchain. The contracts contain an output that is spendable by either party, but the rules required for redemption are different for each party involved.\nOne party (called counterparty 1 or the initiator) generates a secret key and sends the intended trade amount into a smart-contract. The second party (called counterparty 2 or the participant) can only redeem the funds by knowing the secret key. If a pre-determined period of time (typically 48 hours) expires after the smart-contract transaction has been mined or staked and the funds have not been redeemed by the participant, the funds can be refunded back to the initiator\u0026rsquo;s wallet.\nFor simplicity, we assume the initiator wishes to trade Particl for Decred with the participant. The initiator can also trade Decred for Particl and the steps will be the same, but with each step performed on the other blockchain. At this point, the participant is unable to claim the funds from the initiator\u0026rsquo;s Particl smart-contract because the secret key is unknown by them. If the initiator revealed their secret key at this moment, the participant could claim the funds from the contract without ever honoring their end of the trade, leaving the initiator at a loss.\nTo avoid this, the participant creates a similar smart-contract but on the Decred blockchain and sends the intended Decred amount into it. However, for the initiator to redeem the output, their own secret key must be revealed to the participant. For the participant to create their smart-contract, the initiator must reveal not the secret key (since the participant could stil claim funds and not honor their end of the deal), but a cryptographic hash of the secret key to the participant so that the smart-contract can be properly deployed. The participant\u0026rsquo;s contract can equally be refunded after a pre-determined period of time.\nThe initiator then redeems the participant\u0026rsquo;s Decred funds by revealing the secret key to the participant’s smart-contract. The secret key is then extracted from the initiator\u0026rsquo;s redeeming Decred transaction providing the participant with the ability to redeem the initiator\u0026rsquo;s Particl contract.\nThis procedure is atomic (with timeout) as it gives each party a set period of time to redeem their coins on the other blockchain before a refund can be performed. This is the best option for people requiring privacy, and is also probably going to be the cheapest to use.\nThird-Party Integrations  Preview of built-in Swap app in Particl Desktop 3.0  Using the very flexible and modular Particl Desktop wallet, third-parties can easily be integrated to enhance the user experience and provide optional services. One such example is the integration of non-custodial exchanges such as SimpleSwap, StealthEx or Changelly.\nWhile not as private and cheap as atomic swaps, third-party services do offer some benefits. Liquidity and volume, at this point in time, can be much better on centralized exchanges. Some of these services (i.e. SimpleSwap, StealthEx, Changelly) also offer fiat options and pairs. This would allow the Open Marketplace to offer in-wallet fiat payment options.\nParticl will always prioritize decentralized solutions over ones that introduce third-parties. However, payment options need to have volume and liquidity for them to be efficient and cost-effective for the user.\n"});index.add({'id':38,'href':'/tutorial/wallets/particl-cli/','title':"Particl CLI",'content':"    About Particl CLI Features Getting started  Installation Backup \u0026amp; Restore   Usage  Basic commands Informative Actions  Confidential Transactions (Blind)   Wallet unlocking  With enhanced privacy Standard unlocking          Preview of Particl CLI  About Particl CLI Particl-cli offers all the essential features, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t include all the advanced bells and whistles of Particl graphical clients.\nControlled via command line interface, Particl-cli is usually used on remote machines and computers without monitors, e.g. servers and less powerful devices like Raspberry Pi (which make great dedicated staking devices!).\n Download Particl-cli   Report bugs   Also check out Partyman staking utility which is a great tool to manage your staking node with ease – it\u0026rsquo;s beginner-friendly and automates many of the tedious tasks related to maintenance of your node!

For example:\n$ ./particl-cli -stdin # then press [Enter] walletpassphrase # then press [Enter] \u0026quot;\u0026lt;passphrase\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # then press [Enter] \u0026lt;timeout\u0026gt; # then press [Enter] true # then press [Ctrl-D] here to end input Standard unlocking Unlock wallet (optionally for staking only) for timeout seconds:\n$ ./particl-cli walletpassphrase \u0026lt;passphrase\u0026gt; \u0026lt;timeout\u0026gt; [stakingonly]  e.g. walletpassphrase “\u0026lt;my long pass\u0026gt;” 0 true – unlocks the wallet forever (until locked manually or restarted) for staking only\n long password containing spaces should be “in quotes” 0 = unlocked forever; 10 = for 10 seconds and so on true in the end toggles “for staking only”; if you want your wallet completely unlocked (for sending transactions etc.) you can leave it out  "});index.add({'id':39,'href':'/tutorial/security/','title':"Security",'content':"    Backup \u0026amp; Restore wallet Using wallet.dat to completely backup and restore your wallet     "});index.add({'id':40,'href':'/tutorial/advanced/','title':"Advanced",'content':"    "});index.add({'id':41,'href':'/learn/marketplace/data-storage-network/','title':"Data Storage Network (DSN)",'content':"Contrary to on-chain storage, storing data on DSN allows the platform to scale well regardless of the amount of data it uses. This form of storage works without relying on servers and without centralizing powers into masternodes.\nAbout DSN DSN is a generic term that describes a specific set of software with the purpose of storing and retrieving data on the internet. The usage of the term DSN is simply a layer of abstraction.\nIt is not required to know how a specific DSN works internally as long as it can store blobs of data and later retrieve them using a comparable cryptographic identifier. Popular DSNs include BitMessage, IPFS, SMSG, HTTPs, TOR etc.\nImplementation The default (and for the moment, the only) DSN used on Particl is SMSG. It is a P2P BitMessage-like message mixnet that runs parallel to Particl\u0026rsquo;s blockchain. It is hosted on the same nodes that run the Particl blockchain.\n How SMSG works  A small hash of the hosted content is created and stored on the Particl blockchain when it is used to store data on a DSN. To verify the integrity of data when the client retrieves it back from the DSN, its hash is recomputed and compared with the one stored on the Particl blockchain. The data is considered trusted if the hashes match, and rejected by the platform if they don’t.\nRead more about Data Storage Network on OMP  "});index.add({'id':42,'href':'/tutorial/merchants/','title':"Merchants",'content':"    "});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/learn/marketplace/smsg/','title':"Secure Messaging (SMSG)",'content':"About SMSG SMSG is a decentralized P2P message mixnet where all nodes store a copy of everyone\u0026rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted messages and data for a duration of 48 hours (which can be increased for a fee).\n It is the default and most private DSN available for use on the platform.\n The reference implementation is developed in C++ and incorporated into the Particl daemon. It operates parallel to Particl\u0026rsquo;s network and is hosted on the same nodes running the blockchain.\n SMSG network topology  All nodes continuously attempt to decrypt every incoming message, but can only succeed if the node is able to recalculate the HMAC hash accompanying the message. If the hash check fails, then it can not be decrypted by the node, which means the message was either fraudulent, tampered with or meant for another node.\nPrivacy benefits SMSG messages are stripped from of any metadata, therefore it is impossible for anyone to extract information such as IP addresses, sender or receiver. The only metadata not stripped from SMSG messages are the hash, the encryption payload, and a temporary public key.\nRead more about SMSG on OMP  "});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/learn/wallets/hardware/','title':"Hardware wallets",'content':"Advantages They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\nSupported hardware wallets Ledger wallet Particl is currently supported by Ledger Wallet and has been integrated in such a way that it supports cold staking. That means PART coins can be stored offline on a Ledger wallet and still cold stake from any staking node.

The OMP is available as an open-source protocol on Particl\u0026rsquo;s Github page and is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\nRead Open Market Protocol documentation for in-depth info.  Design The Open Market Protocol is divided into two distinct formats.\n Public listing format – contains all the necessary data related to a certain item or service listed for sale. This includes the title, description, images, payment destination, and other similar information. Private message format – contains all the data that must remain private. It includes the transaction information, the conversations between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer\u0026rsquo;s address.   The protocol has few virtues in mind: extensibility and privacy.\n Extensibility Technology moves at an exponential rate. The very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough to allow any developer to expand it. The development of both decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young. Since there aren\u0026rsquo;t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria, nor may there ever be, the protocol must accommodate for it.\nPrivacy Privacy is also an important cornerstone of the OMP. The protocol specifies a format for private messages that buyers and sellers must use to communicate. We strongly recommend that these messages be exchanged over end-to-end encrypted communication channels. Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security.\nAdditionally, blockchains are open public books that are full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing this protocol as it puts users at risk.\nPortability The online e-commerce industry is a fragmented space. A few big companies such as Amazon and eBay have established a dominant position in the market. A tremendous amount of small online stores are also not to be neglected. There are a plethora of software applications to set up online shops, but almost none of them are designed for interoperability.\nOne of the frustrations online merchants suffer is the lack of portability of their inventory data between different online marketplaces. The more markets products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus, the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet, importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process. This is often done on purpose to prevent vendors from using competing platforms. Up until now, vendors are limited to either importing CSV files (which have many limitations) or using third-party software that manages many marketplaces.\nThe lack of inventory portability by large enterprises is deliberate. It is a strategy to prevent vendors from offering their goods on competing platforms. Moving large amounts of inventory data to a competitor is a painstaking process that restricts vendor\u0026rsquo;s economic potential.\nThe OMP allows for full inventory data portability, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. It also lets vendors easily assign images as well as payment and shipping details to specific listings. Transferring data to other marketplaces that follow the OMP specification becomes very straightforward.\nThe current rise of blockchain technology has given programmers a toolset to interact with money in a way that wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible before. The OMP payment formats operate with the Bitcoin blockchain and any derivatives. It also allows merchants to accept a multitude of virtual currencies on a per item basis.\nA unified protocol is a step in the right direction. It fosters a more open and free e-commerce experience where portability, not fragmentation, is glorified.\n"});index.add({'id':46,'href':'/learn/misc/','title':"Misc.",'content':"    Proposals Community initiatives to advance the Particl ecosystem     Particl Foundation Particl Foundation is a non-profit organisation, serving the Particl ecosystem and promoting awareness of financial privacy     "});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/tags/atomic-swaps/','title':"atomic swaps",'content':""});index.add({'id':48,'href':'/tags/bitcoin/','title':"bitcoin",'content':""});index.add({'id':49,'href':'/tags/blockchain/','title':"blockchain",'content':""});index.add({'id':50,'href':'/tags/bulletproofs/','title':"bulletproofs",'content':""});index.add({'id':51,'href':'/categories/','title':"Categories",'content':""});index.add({'id':52,'href':'/tags/community/','title':"community",'content':""});index.add({'id':53,'href':'/tags/CT/','title':"CT",'content':""});index.add({'id':54,'href':'/tags/DSD/','title':"DSD",'content':""});index.add({'id':55,'href':'/tags/fees/','title':"fees",'content':""});index.add({'id':56,'href':'/tags/governance/','title':"governance",'content':""});index.add({'id':57,'href':'/tags/important/','title':"important",'content':""});index.add({'id':58,'href':'/tags/Ledger-wallet/','title':"Ledger wallet",'content':""});index.add({'id':59,'href':'/tags/lightning/','title':"lightning",'content':""});index.add({'id':60,'href':'/tags/MAD-escrow/','title':"MAD escrow",'content':""});index.add({'id':61,'href':'/tags/market/','title':"market",'content':""});index.add({'id':62,'href':'/tags/OMP/','title':"OMP",'content':""});index.add({'id':63,'href':'/tags/Particl-CLI/','title':"Particl CLI",'content':""});index.add({'id':64,'href':'/tags/Particl-Copay/','title':"Particl Copay",'content':""});index.add({'id':65,'href':'/tags/Particl-Core/','title':"Particl Core",'content':""});index.add({'id':66,'href':'/tags/Particl-Desktop/','title':"Particl Desktop",'content':""});index.add({'id':67,'href':'/','title':"Particl Wiki",'content':" Official site   Latest news   Twitter   Welcome to Particl Wiki!
